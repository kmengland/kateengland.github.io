<p style = "font-size:16px;color:black;align=center;"> <b> Welcome to my first web page! I am a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign majoring in Math + Computer Science.
You would think with my major that I would have a little more experience with creating websites... but here I am! One thing at a time, right? </b> </p>

I graduated from St. Francis High School in 2017. I've been involved in volleyball, softball, and the National Honors Society (just to name a few).
I'm the oldest in my family of five; I have two younger siblings in high school. We have an Australian Shephard named Coco and we will be getting a Husky in January!
We also have a guinea pig named Poe in addition to various aquatic animals. To the right, I have a picture from Badlands National Park. My family is a huge fan of 
traveling to National Parks. You name a Park, we've probably been there! My favorite was Yellowstone National Park -- once you get over the sulfur smell you can really enjoy the sights. 
If you want to learn some more about the National Parks, I would visit 
<a href = "https://www.nps.gov/findapark/index.htm"> this page. </a>

As for experience with computer science, I took two classes my senior year -- there weren't many classes offered so I took advantage of what I could! 
I took Visual Basic and Honors Programming in Java at my high school. My Java class gave me a good background for starting classes at U of I. For the longest time 
I thought I wanted to be a veterinarian, but not being able to stand blood puts a bit of a hindrance on that. Since I am a very logical person and computers have 
always fascinated me, I decided to take the computer science path. I am also considering a minor in enviornmental science because I love the outdoors. The cool thing about computer 
science is that it can be applied in almost any area of study. For someone who is pretty indecisive, that works well for me! 
If you want to see my final project for CS125 where I coded a dog simulation game, you can check it out at
that out <a href = "https://github.com/kmengland/FinalDogMP"> my GitHub. </a> Stay tuned for more projects in the future!
